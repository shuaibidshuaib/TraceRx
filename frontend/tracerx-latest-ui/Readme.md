## Integration Note

>  **Important:**
> If you want to use the scanner app after uploading a medicine through **TraceRx Admin V2**, ensure the API endpoint reads from the **`drug_batches`** collection instead of the **`drug`** collection.

This ensures that the verification data displayed to the user matches the immutable batch records stored on Hedera and Firebase.

---

##  Future Enhancements

* **Decentralized Identity (DID)** for verified user profiles.
* **AI-based fraud pattern alerts** integrated into user analytics.
