# TraceRx Admin Portal

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **TraceRx Admin Portal**, a cutting-edge web application designed to streamline the management and tracking of pharmaceutical batches. Built with a focus on accuracy, security, and user experience, this tool empowers administrators to upload and monitor drug batch details seamlessly, ensuring compliance with industry standards and enhancing supply chain transparency. Developed as part of a hands-on coding journey, this project demonstrates modern web development practices and real-world API integration, making it a standout solution in healthcare technology.

## Features
- **Multi-Step Form**: Intuitive three-step process for entering drug information, batch details, and confirmation.
- **Real-Time Validation**: Dynamic input validation with clear error messaging to ensure data integrity.
- **API Integration**: Submits data to a live backend at `https://tracerx-backend-production.up.railway.app/api/drugs/upload` for authentic processing.
- **Responsive Design**: Polished, mobile-friendly interface with a modern gradient aesthetic and interactive elements.
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for success, errors, and resets, enhancing user interaction.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+R to reset the form and Enter to navigate or submit, boosting efficiency.
- **Demo Mode**: Preloaded demo data via `window.addDemoData()` for quick testing.

## Technical Details
### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0 with a single-page architecture for simplicity and performance.
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with responsive design, featuring gradients, shadows, and animations.
- **API**: RESTful integration with a production-grade backend hosted on Railway.
- **Development Tools**: React Scripts 5.0.1 for a streamlined build process.

### Architecture
The application is a single-file React component (`App.js`) that handles all logic, rendering, and state management. This monolithic approach ensures maintainability while the CSS (`styles.css`) delivers a professional UI. The API call uses `fetch` with JSON payloads, handling errors gracefully with user feedback.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd tracerx-react-app
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.
4. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The `build/` folder contains the optimized production assets.

### Usage
- Navigate the form using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- Fill in fields (Drug Name, Manufacturer, Batch ID, Expiry Date) with validation applied.
- Submit on the confirmation step to send data to the API.
- Use Ctrl+R to reset or `window.addDemoData()` in the console for demo data.
- Check the result section for API responses or errors.

## Innovation & Impact
The TraceRx Admin Portal addresses a critical need in pharmaceutical supply chain management by providing a user-friendly interface for batch uploads, reducing manual errors, and integrating with a live backend for real-time data processing. Its design prioritizes accessibility and feedback, making it suitable for adoption in pharmacies, manufacturers, and regulatory bodies. The use of a production API demonstrates scalability, while the responsive design ensures usability across devicesâ€”key factors for global healthcare applications.

## Challenges Overcome
- **Initial Interactivity Issues**: Resolved complex event-handling bugs through systematic debugging and minimal viable testing.
- **API Integration**: Successfully implemented real-time submission, handling network errors and backend responses.
- **Design Enhancement**: Transformed a basic layout into a visually appealing interface without compromising functionality.

## Future Enhancements
- **Authentication**: Add user login to secure the portal.
- **Data Visualization**: Include charts for batch tracking analytics.
- **File Uploads**: Support image or document uploads for batch records.
- **Localization**: Expand to multiple languages for global use.
